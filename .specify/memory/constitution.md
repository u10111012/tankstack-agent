# TanStack Agent Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. TanStack-First Architecture
### II. Type Safety & Runtime Validation
### III. Component Architecture & Styling
### IV. Server-Side Rendering & Data Loading
### V. AI Integration Standards
## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Comments SHOULD explain "why", not "what"

### Testing

- Vitest MUST be used for unit and integration tests
- 
### File Organization

- Routes in src/routes/ following TanStack Router file-based conventions

### Git & Deployment

- Commit messages SHOULD follow conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)

## Quality Gates

Before merging any feature, verify:

1. **Type Safety**: `pnpm build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
2. 
## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution MAY be amended when:
- Project requirements fundamentally change (e.g., moving away from TanStack)

Amendments MUST:
- Increment version following semantic versioning
- Document rationale in Sync Impact Report

### Version Semantics

- **MAJOR**: Principle removal or redefinition that breaks existing patterns

- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

### Compliance Review

All planning documents generated by /speckit commands MUST:
- Reference this constitution in "Constitution Check" sections
- Justify any deviations from principles in "Complexity Tracking"
- Ensure technical decisions align with architecture standards
